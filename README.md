<h1>Use Keras Models With Scikit-Learn
For General Machine Learning</h1>

<p>
The scikit-learn library is the most popular library for general machine learning in Python.
In this project we will discover how we can use deep learning models from Keras with the
scikit-learn library in Python. Primary purpose of this project:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
How to wrap a Keras model for use with the scikit-learn machine learning library.
  </li>
  <li>
How to easily evaluate Keras models using cross validation in scikit-learn.
  </li>
  <li>
How to tune Keras model hyperparameters using grid search in scikit-learn
  </li>
 </ul>
<h3>Grid Search Deep Learning Model Parameters</h3>
<p>we use a grid search to evaluate diâ†µerent configurations for our neural
network model and report on the combination that provides the best estimated performance</p>
